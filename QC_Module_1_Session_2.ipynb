Here, we will restrict ourselves to a very early and very simple method of encryption, called **\"simple replacement\"**, in order to focus on the **quantum part** of this protocol. The quantum part could be adapted to many other protocols with relatively few changes.\n",

A pop-culture instance of these is the **cryptoquote or cryptogram puzzle**, in which a quote or phrase is encrypted using simple replacement, and the player is tasked with decrypting it.

For example, we might assume that the states Eve sends on to Bob are always exactly those she obtained upon measurement. Or we might assume that she randomly chooses a state experimentally consistent with her measurement. More fundamentally, the language here assumes that Eve actually makes a measurement, as opposed to storing the state on another quantum system and sending on a random qubit to Bob.
